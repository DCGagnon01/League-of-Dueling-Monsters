League of Dueling Monsters
Rule Book

Turns are carried out in a phase-like manner.
Each turn always starts in the start-phase and ends with the end phase.

1. In the start phase nothing happens.
2. In the draw phase the card from the top of your deck is added to your hand.
3. In the main phase, you get to play your monsters.
	-You may only play 1 monster per turn.
	-You can only summon a monster of 4 stars or less without a sacrifice.
	-Monsters that are 5 or 6 stars require 1 sacrifice.
	-Monsters that are 7 or more stars require 2 sacrifices.
	-You can also change monsters to attack or defense position (only once per turn).
4. In the attack phase, you get to attack your opponent and/or their monsters.
	-The first turn in a game may not attack.
	-Each monster may only attack once per attack phase.
	-You may only attack your opponent directly if they control no monsters
	-When attacking
		-if both monsters are in attack position, the monster with the higher attack
		wins, and the difference in ATK is dealt to the player with the weaker monster.
		-if one monster is in defense, the ATK must be higher to destroy the defending
		monster, no damage is dealt, if your ATK is lower, you take damage equal to the
		difference, neither monster is destroyed in this situation.
5. In the end phase, nothing happens, the turn moves to the other player.

The game ends when a player loses all their life points, the player that has life points remaining
is declared the victor.
